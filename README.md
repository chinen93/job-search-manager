# Job Search Manager

Managing my job applications with a simple Excel file became inefficient once I crossed the 500-application mark.

This project is both a **personal tool** and a **learning opportunity**:

1. To deepen my experience building with Go.
2. To sharpen my frontend development skills.
3. To create a system for storing and analyzing job applications, with the goal of identifying trends across positions: such as recurring keywords, industries, technologies, and other useful metadata.

The aim isnâ€™t just to store data, but to extract meaningful insights and better understand the direction of my job search.

## Project Structure

The project is separated into two parts in the same repository

- **Backend**: Built with Go, responsible for data storage and API operations.
- **Frontend**: A user interface to interact with the stored data.

Each part is self-contained and can be run locally.

> **Note**: The project is intended for local use only. Since job searching is typically done on a personal machine, there's no need to deploy it to the cloud. Keeping everything local simplifies usage and keeps all data in one place.
